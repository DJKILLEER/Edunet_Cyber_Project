# Secure Data Hiding in Images using Steganography

## 📖 Project Overview
This project focuses on securely hiding sensitive data within images using **LSB (Least Significant Bit) Steganography**. By modifying pixel values, data can be embedded without noticeable changes, ensuring confidentiality and security. 

## 🔍 Problem Statement
In today's digital world, securing sensitive data is a major challenge. Traditional encryption methods are often detectable, making them vulnerable to attacks. Steganography provides a covert way to embed secret data within images, ensuring privacy without raising suspicion. This project leverages **LSB (Least Significant Bit) steganography** to **hide and extract messages from images** while maintaining their visual integrity.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries Used**:
  - `Pillow` (for image processing)
  - `NumPy` (for efficient pixel manipulation)
  - `Tkinter` (for GUI-based file selection)
  - `OpenCV` (for additional image handling)

## 🌟 Unique Features (WOW Factor)
- **High Security**: Hidden data remains undetectable to the human eye.
- **Lossless Image Quality**: The modification is minimal, ensuring the image looks unchanged.
- **Supports Multiple Formats**: Works with `.png`, `.jpg`, and `.bmp` images.
- **Customizable Encoding**: Users can define their own encoding keys.
- **GUI-based File Selection**: Simplifies user interaction with a graphical interface.

## 👤 Who are the End Users?
- **Cybersecurity Professionals**: To securely transmit confidential information.
- **Journalists & Whistleblowers**: For covert communication.
- **Forensic Investigators**: To hide and analyze critical case-related data.
- **Developers & Enthusiasts**: Exploring steganography for secure communication.

## 🖥️ How to Run the Project?
1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install pillow numpy opencv-python tkinter
2. Run the Script
   ```sh
   python steganography.py
## 🔮 Future Scope
- **Integration with AI:**: Detect anomalies in steganographic images.
- **Mobile App Development**: Create an Android/iOS app for secure image-based data transfer..
- **Blockchain for Verification**: Secure encoded images using blockchain to prevent tampering.
- **Multi-layered Steganography**: Apply multiple layers of encoding for enhanced security.

## 🎯 Conclusion
- **Cybersecurity Professionals**: To securely transmit confidential information.
- ✅ Future improvements can **enhance security and usability**, making it a **powerful tool** in cybersecurity and secure communication.
- ✅ This project successfully implements secure **data hiding** using **LSB Steganography**.
- ✅ It enables covert communication by embedding data within images **while preserving their quality**.
